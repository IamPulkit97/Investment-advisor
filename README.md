# About the Project
Finding our clientâ€™s potential investment amount for further investing in stocks according to risk taking profile from the BSE 500 data that was provided 

## Aim
- First, we had to connect google sheets with python using Gspread
- Then, we had to use Income/Expense report of an individual to calculate his amount after expenses and that amount would have been the investment amount
- After that we had to use the BSE 500 data to see the best stocks to recommend based on that individual risk taking capacity

## Tech Stack used:
- Python(Numpy & Pandas)
- Google Sheets
- Gspread API
- Microsoft Excel
- Microsoft Powerpoint

## Prerequisite

- In order to use Gspread, one should hold google developer account so you can be assigned an authorization to connect Python with Gsheets, for more info on this  
  see the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bu5wXjz2KvU)
- Python IDE, for this project I have used jupyter notebook
- Then excel, powerpoint to collate the date and make a dashboard that can be finally be shown through PPT
- Finally some knowledge about stocks, BSE to be specific 

## Pandas 

 ### Task One:
  
- Fist we with the help of Gspread imported the sheet in the python
- Then we used Pandas to create dataframe for all the particular files
- After that we calculated amount to be invested by substracting all the expense values from the income and displayed that amount that can be invested back into the
  gsheets
  
 ### Task Two:
 
 - There was already a drop down menu in the sheets which had 4 values containing risk taking profile, (Low risk taking, moderate risk taking,Risk taking,
   High risk taking)
 - Based on the changing drop down value we had to calculate their respective investemnt prospect. In other words which comapnies can the individual invest
   in.
